My goal is to become a JavaScript Developer, improving my programming skills is main priority
for me now. Although I have no experience in software development, it's very interesting and varied
sphere, and I want to grow in it. Previously, I worked as a service engineer for fire alarm systems,
but now I want to get more creative and intellectual job.

Study these technologies:
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Git

As an example of my coding practice, this is the solution of the task on codewars:

function strangeMath(n, k){
    let arr = Array(n+1).fill(0);
    arr = arr.map((x,i) => i);
    arr.sort();
    return arr.indexOf(k);
} 

Projects
Although I have no many projects, I'll fix it soon) Now there are two studing projects.
